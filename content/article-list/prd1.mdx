## What is a Retrospective meeting?
### Purpose


Intro:
Take a moment and write something down that you are proud of which you yourself accomplished.
Do the same for someone else in the group.

Write down what you think you will do differently next time - not what someone else should have done differently



What is a retro?

Retro’s are a time to bond - not a moratorium.
- moratoriums go by many names in the tech world, but they are essentially deep dives into problems.  Retro’s look backwards on the full scope of what was accomplished.
- You all had tension during this project, I know because I went through it.
    - You should acknowledge and reflect upon that tension, but avoid making it the focal point of a retro.  Tension should be resolved in the moment  or in a moratorium - not delayed to be resolved during a retro.  Carrying pent up emotions into a retro is a sure fire way to spoil that bonding opportunity and that’s not what a retro is about.
- Often in the workplace, they are celebratory by nature in order to amp the group up for the next great project you need to tackle

This, along with all moments in this bootcamp, is a time to network.
- These are the people you will be going on a job hunt with.  You want to give off your best impression at every moment to every individual in this cohort.
- You will be referrals for one another in the future
    - When the interviewer calls someone in your cohort, you want them to say, “YEA, I saw Taylor at his worst, sleep deprived, frustrated with a coding challenge, and he still found a way to make people laugh while getting his work done.”
- That means, be professional.  IN EVERYTHING you do, but doubly so now.
The role of the Product Manager in the retro
- It is not to manage the emotions of the group - but it is to keep the conversation moving along.  When folks are reiterating the same concept over and over, say you’ll collect one more comment and move on.

On receiving feedback
    - You all have a passion for this, you all are passionate about changing your lives to become an engineer.   That passion is a double edge sword.  When you care about your work, your emotions can get entangled with the feedback you receive.
    - As a result, It’s possible that criticism of your work can be interpreted as a reflection of yourself, specifically your self worth.
    - (Taylor’s personal antidote - if you have had a similar experience, definitely share it, otherwise deliver the underlying message of “don’t tie your self worth to your work.”
        - This is a lesson I had to learn.  There was a component of every retro as a product manager that was specifically on, “What the product manager could do better”
            - I’m a highly emotional person & I’m tremendously passionate about the things I set my mind to.
            - The reason you’re stressed is you’re passionate about it, you care about it. If you didn’t feel stress or have any sort of anxiety, it means you didn’t care about it.
            - Sometimes this was great, I left feeling phenomenal
            - Other times it was horrible, I left feeling absolutely atrocious about myself because I did not disentangle that feedback from my own personal value.
            - It took a long time for me to disassociate my personal value from my work performance, but when I did, both my view of myself and my work improved.
            - Be grateful for any feedback you get during a retro - it is all intended to assist you and strengthen you from a work perspective and it is in no way a reflection of yourself.
On giving feedback?
- When you give feedback, think about your phrasing.  If you believe there is any chance the individual receiving the feedback might feel defensive about the feedback provided, rephrase your comment or don’t say it. Often shifting this to reflect your individual opinion is the best approach here.
- It is not the duty of anyone here to improve anyones performance but their own.  Ask for feedback if you want it on a specific subject.
